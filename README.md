This is a beginner-level slot machine game written in Python. It simulates a basic slot machine where the player can bet, spin, and potentially win based on symbol matches.

## Features
- Text-based CLI interface
- Symbol matching logic
- User betting and balance tracking
- Basic input validation

## Skills Practiced
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- User input handling
- Working with Copilot to assist with logic

## Why I Built It
This project is part of my Python learning journey. I focused on understanding how each function works and getting familiar with how larger code structures come together.

More projects coming soon as I progress.
